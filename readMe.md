Hold Close was the first videogame i created all by myself ever.

The game is based on the Entity-Component design and most of the features are data driven,
so a parser was implemented to read XML files that could contain information about Levels, Characters and AI of NPCs.

The choosen langauge was Java but many Physical simulation functions are taken by a C++ interface.
This was a university course project, so many features were required to be in a certain way.

I will probably update this (mostly i would like to balance it better) but currently I am working on my dissertation, so this will have to wait
